# Sports Polling App

You can follow the below commands to test and run the app.

- `yarn start` - dev server

- `yarn build` - output to directory to run on a web server

- `yarn test` - run tests via `jest`

## TODOS

- started creating a GraphQL backend, went down a rabbit hole. Would like to persist data to DB.
- login system to access pages
- more tests!
- be able to dynamically pull country + sports team data without having to hardcode anything:
  - https://restcountries.eu/
  - https://www.football-data.org/documentation/api#requesting-a-resource
  - use whatever other public API's are available via a GQL adapter layer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
